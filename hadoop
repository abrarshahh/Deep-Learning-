When you experience issues with Putty freezing while starting Hadoop daemons on your EC2 instance, it typically indicates resource constraints or configuration problems. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide to help you troubleshoot and resolve the issue:

### Step-by-Step Troubleshooting and Fixes

1. **Verify EC2 Instance Resources**:
   - Ensure your EC2 instance has sufficient memory and CPU resources. Hadoop requires a decent amount of resources, especially for Namenode and Datanode. For a basic setup, a t2.medium or larger instance is recommended.
   - Check your instance type and consider upgrading if necessary.

2. **Check for System Resource Utilization**:
   - Connect to your EC2 instance using Putty and run the following commands to check CPU and memory usage:
     ```bash
     top
     free -m
     ```
   - Look for any processes consuming excessive resources. If your system is running out of memory or CPU, it could cause freezing.

3. **Increase Java Heap Size**:
   - Hadoop daemons rely heavily on Java, and insufficient heap size can lead to freezing. Increase the heap size for Namenode and Datanode by editing the Hadoop environment configuration file (`hadoop-env.sh`).
     ```bash
     sudo nano /usr/local/hadoop/etc/hadoop/hadoop-env.sh
     ```
   - Add or update the following lines:
     ```bash
     export HADOOP_NAMENODE_OPTS="-Xmx2g -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote $HADOOP_NAMENODE_OPTS"
     export HADOOP_DATANODE_OPTS="-Xmx2g -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote $HADOOP_DATANODE_OPTS"
     ```

4. **Configure Proper DNS Resolution**:
   - Ensure that your EC2 instance can resolve its own hostname. Edit `/etc/hosts` to include your hostname and IP address.
     ```bash
     sudo nano /etc/hosts
     ```
   - Add the following line:
     ```bash
     <private-ip-address>   <hostname>
     ```
   - Replace `<private-ip-address>` with your instance's private IP and `<hostname>` with your instance's hostname.

5. **Check and Configure Firewall Settings**:
   - Ensure that your security groups and network ACLs allow traffic on the necessary Hadoop ports (default HDFS port 50070 for Namenode, 50075 for Datanode).
   - Update the security group associated with your EC2 instance to allow inbound traffic on these ports.

6. **Verify Java Installation**:
   - Ensure you have the correct version of Java installed and that it is properly configured in your environment.
     ```bash
     java -version
     ```
   - Hadoop typically requires Java 8.

7. **Start Hadoop Daemons in the Background**:
   - Starting Hadoop daemons in the background can prevent Putty from freezing. Use the `nohup` command:
     ```bash
     nohup hdfs namenode &
     nohup hdfs datanode &
     nohup yarn resourcemanager &
     nohup yarn nodemanager &
     ```
   - This will run the commands in the background and prevent Putty from freezing.

8. **Check Hadoop Logs for Errors**:
   - Hadoop logs provide valuable information about what might be going wrong. Check the log files located in the Hadoop logs directory:
     ```bash
     cd /usr/local/hadoop/logs
     tail -f hadoop-<username>-namenode-<hostname>.log
     tail -f hadoop-<username>-datanode-<hostname>.log
     ```
   - Look for any errors or warnings that could indicate configuration issues or resource constraints.

### Accessing HDFS via Browser

- Ensure you are trying to access the correct URL. The default port for Namenode is `50070`.
  ```plaintext
  http://<ec2-instance-public-ip>:50070
  ```

### Example Configuration
If your EC2 instance's public IP is `34.201.123.456`, you should access HDFS Namenode at:
```plaintext
http://34.201.123.456:50070
```

### Summary
- Verify and upgrade EC2 instance resources if necessary.
- Check and manage system resource utilization.
- Adjust Java heap size in `hadoop-env.sh`.
- Ensure correct DNS resolution and firewall settings.
- Start Hadoop daemons using `nohup` to prevent Putty from freezing.
- Review Hadoop logs for any error messages.

By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the issue of Putty freezing and access your Hadoop ecosystem on your EC2 instance.
